    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am Sushobhit, currently pursuing a B.Tech degree from Graphic Era University. I have a strong command over Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and a natural interest in proving the correctness of various algorithms, especially when it comes to the fascinating world of greedy algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my educational journey, I have undertaken numerous projects in diverse domains. I've leveraged my skills in various programming languages and technologies to bring my ideas to life. Some of the technologies I've worked with include Flutter, Python (Machine Learning), C++, PHP, HTML, and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        My passion for problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and creative coding has driven me to explore and create solutions in different fields. I am always excited to take on new challenges and learn from each experience.
